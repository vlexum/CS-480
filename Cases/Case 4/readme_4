- full preemptive operation with five processes

- several attempts to allocate
  -- some fail due to not enough memory
  -- one fails due to overlap request

- a few attempts to access
  -- most succeed but one or more fail

- this shows the diagnostic memory map,
  but this should not be shown in simulation
