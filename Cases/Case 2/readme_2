Second attempt uses correct base and offset values so there is no overlap
- system works correctly, no seg fault
- at end, process zero cleans up its memory
  - note that when the memory is cleaned up,
    adjacent empty memory locations are combined

- diagnostic memory map is provided,
  should not be in normal simulation
